# AWAY Collective

This is the website for the AWAY collective, served at <https://awaycollective.org>.

## Development

To test the website locally, you will need Zola. Follow the installation instructions 
[here](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/).

Once you have zola, you can run `zola serve` in this folder to serve the website. It'll 
output a link you can look at in your browser. The page will automatically reload when
you make changes to the content.

To change members, press articles, or works, update the JSON files in `meta`. Note that
you will need to update the files in `static` if you're planning on adding to or changing
the works.

Once you're done, commit to a branch and make a PR. (This process is somewhat complicated.
Feel free to ask one of us, or your local Claude, for assistance.) When your PR is merged,
it will be automatically deployed to the website.

## Miscellaneous

This is a conversion of the original site, produced by [Smittable LLC](https://smittable.net/), 
to a Zola template to allow for modification by other AWAY members. Original credit for the
website resides with them.

This website is not final and may change to facilitate the addition of more information
in future.
